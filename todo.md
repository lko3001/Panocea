# To do

<!-- - Add delete functionality -->

<!-- - Move "CRUD" function inside the Global so that it also changes the `userData` state -->

<!-- - Search for all `IMPORTANT` words in the project -->

<!-- - Look for `UpdateFile` -->

<!-- - Remove unwanted `console.logs` -->

- Fix `middleware.ts`
- Fix `useStates` in `/finance`
- Wait for just the pages that need to login
<!-- - Add middleware for pages that need login -->
- Remove `userData` button
- Convert clock button into a link because it's not actionable by middle-clicking
- Add "offline" functionality with PWA
- Name generator
- Look images in `/email`
- Add a guide for new users (there's the `newUser` page in `...nextauth` kind of)
